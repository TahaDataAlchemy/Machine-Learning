the file is telling that how standardization works 

Some KeyPoints of Standardization 

1) Its a technique to standardize Input or Independent Variables in to a fixed range 
2) standardization also called Z-score Normalization
3) Formula for standardization is 
                Xi - X/STD 
                xi = column value
                X = whole column mean
                sTD = standard deviation
4) after scaling  using Standardization std = 1  and mean = 0
5) Technique to make mean = 0 and std = 1 is also called Mean Centric
6)  if std >1 we squeeze data to make std 1 and if std <1 we expand data to make std = 1
7) Standardization Never Changed the distribution of Data
8) it change only the measurement of scaling the data

Nessacary Explanation of Code is written on the Jupyter File , You will Understand it Correctly 

The main intuition of file is we are seeing that how algo effect if we scale the data and if we dont
