Definition 

A technique to scale each feature  to a scale of 0 to 1 based on its minimum and maximum values in a dataset

                                          **TechniquesofNormalization**

1)MinMaxScaling
2)Mean Normalization
3)Max absolute
4)Robust Scaling

                                           **MINMAXSCALING**

Formula for MinMaxScaling
Xi = (Xi-Xmin)/(Xmax - Xmin)
Xi = Current Value of Dataset
Xmin = minimum Value Of Dataset
Xmax = maximum Value of Dataset

For Example

Weight    Normalization
  130           1        
  67            0.21
  50            0
  90            0.5

Working =         Xi = (130 - 50)/(130-50)

Actually the MinMaxScaler do is to convert data from its scale of original distribution to the scale of 0 and 1

                                            **MeanNormalization**
