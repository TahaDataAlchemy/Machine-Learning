Linear Regression README
Equation of a Line
In the equation 
�
=
�
�
+
�
y=mx+c, 
�
m represents the slope of the line, and 
�
c represents the y-intercept.

Slope (
�
m):
The slope (
�
m) of a line describes its steepness or incline. It indicates how much 
�
y changes for a unit change in 
�
x. A positive slope implies an upward trend, while a negative slope implies a downward trend.

Y-intercept (
�
c):
The y-intercept (
�
c) is the point where the line intersects the y-axis. It represents the value of 
�
y when 
�
x is 0, determining the starting point of the line on the y-axis.

Example
Consider a linear relationship between hours studied (
�
x) and test scores (
�
y). If 
�
=
2
m=2 and 
�
=
5
c=5, the equation 
�
=
2
�
+
5
y=2x+5 predicts the test score based on hours studied.

Aim of Linear Regression
The aim is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the distance between predicted and actual points.

Cost Function
The cost function quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values. It's minimized to find the best-fit line.

Gradient Descent
Gradient descent optimizes the linear regression equation by adjusting slope (
�
m) and y-intercept (
�
c) parameters iteratively.

Derivation of Parameters
Derivatives of cost function with respect to 
�
m and 
�
c guide parameter updates towards minimizing the cost function.

Implementation
Implementing gradient descent helps find optimal parameters that minimize prediction error, resulting in accurate predictions.

Process
Start with initial 
�
m and 
�
c values.
Use current 
�
m and 
�
c to predict values.
Compute cost function.
Update parameters using gradient descent.
Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence.
Conclusion
Linear regression with gradient descent optimizes parameters to fit data, enabling accurate predictions in real-world scenarios.
